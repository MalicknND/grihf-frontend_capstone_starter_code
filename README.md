# StayHealthy Inc. Website Project

## Project Overview
StayHealthy Inc. is a non-profit organization committed to improving healthcare infrastructure in remote areas with limited medical resources. This project is part of the "Go Digital" initiative, aimed at creating a website to connect patients with doctors anytime, anywhere, enhancing healthcare accessibility.

## Problem Statement
Many patients in remote areas struggle to access timely medical assistance due to:
- Lack of nearby hospitals or doctors (within a 50-mile radius).
- Long waiting times to meet a doctor.
- Emergency situations leading to life-threatening conditions or loss of lives.

With increased internet availability in these regions, this initiative will help patients consult general practitioners and specialists promptly.
